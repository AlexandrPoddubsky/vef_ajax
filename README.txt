Views Exposed Forms Ajax Support
================================

Adds #ajax support to Views Exposed Forms. 
Since Views Exposed Forms are $_GET forms only, #ajax callbacks won't work there by default.
This module adds this ability. Just enable it and create your #ajax callbacks for any exposed form
element.

This module is the adopted version of the patch here: https://drupal.org/node/1183418, hopefully it will
be submitted to Views soon and you won't need this module anymore, but for now it will save you.
